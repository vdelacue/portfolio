### **Summary**

Throughout my life I have been fearless about diving into new technologies
and continueingto learn more in the world of programming. I am an out of the box thinker looking for full-stack
developer projects that challenge me and enable me to utilizes my creative, organizational, and designing skills.
I enjoy analyzing problems and building systems to solve them. This site showcases some projects 

---

### **Explanation**

This site was built 

#### _Phase one_ of the application used:

> - **HTML5** to provide the basic structure and backbone of the application layout.
> - **CS3** & **bootstrap** to style and for flexible layouts, flexible images and cascading style sheet media queries that create the desired views.
> - **Javascript** and **JQuery** to create interactivity..

From the start of _Phase One_ **Vanilla Javascript** was utilized for animation and **DOM Scripting** for events and functionality. After the basic structure was setup some distinctive and attractive features were added with **CS3**. A fun Easter Egg was included when you click to see Resume PDF. **JQuery** and **Javascript** event handling was used to animate light bulb picture in the About Section.

_Phase two_ consisted of refactoring styling to desired views and continuing to improve user interaction and design layout.


### _Phase One_ Home Page

### _Color_Palette_Adopted

Here are some issues during development I ran into with the page.

### _Inspiration_For_Site

Here is the site I saw that inspired my portfolio page.

### **Problem**

During development several issues occured regarding image displays and rendering content in a visually pleasing manner while maintaining color pallette and desired layout. I incorporated a particles.js file. While visually impressive the complex code used to render the particles resulted in several layout issues and conflicted with my elements and classes.

### _Image_of_Problem_Phase_Two

You can see below that I encounted some display issues during development.

### **Solution**

Isolating each section and clearing writing out psuedo code helped target problem areas. Using Dev tools inspect I was able to manipulate and target problematic elements and structure faults. Piece by piece I was able to render desired look and I continue to make improvements. Motto being make it work then make it work better.

---

### **Results**

While I enjoy leveraging the use of **Bootstrap** and JQuery it is important to me to have a strong foundation in fundamentals like CSS and HTML for Front-End. I look forward to taking my project to the next level by building a Back-End and including much more interactivity and hidden functionality in the Site. 
Many of the frameworks, libraries and packages used today bypass the need to write such lengthy code and make frontend web development much easier. However it is important to understand what all these frameworks libraries and packages are accomplishing behind the scenes. This knowledge is essential to really understand programming and what is happening when a user enters and interacts with a site or application.

---

### **Conclusion**

Staying organized and writing clean psuedo code that is univerally understood (not just by me) is crucial in web development. I take pride in my organization that was adopted during the development of this page and will continue to apply these fundamentals in future projects.

There are many programmers out in the world that blindly use libraries, frameworks and packages without knowing what they are executing or doing behind the scenes. It is very similar to the way people use the english language and use acronyms without knowing their meaning or what they stand for. Of course you can properly use many words without knowing their origin or true meaning. For example, many people use the word _zip_ code every day not knowing that it stands for “Zoning Improvement Plan” a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) since 1963. _Laser_ stands for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”, _Scuba_ stands for “Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, _Taser_ stands for “Thomas A Swift Electric Rifle, _CARE_ Package stands for “Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere” Packages, and so on…

The point is, all these acronyms are used by people regularly in communication, without these people being aware of the meaning behind these words. A similar situation occurs in programming. Many shortcuts, abbreviations, packages, libraries and frameworks have been created and adopted by programmers. These programmers have not bothered to learn what these consolidated lines of code actually mean and thus sometimes fall victim to sloppy unorganized code that is difficult to follow with little psuedo code. Luckily, thanks to my education and determination to build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, I do not fall victim to this “TechnoTardic” Naiveté.
