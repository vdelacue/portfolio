# **Portfolio Project** 

 In this site I have showcased past projects and provide a current PDF of my Resume as well as links to contact me via various social and professional networks. There is also a link to subscribe to my newsletter featuring current and upcoming projects. Do not be afraid to subscribe I hate spam just as much as you do!

Here is a direct link to the site [Vanessa de La Cuetara's Portfolio](http://vdelacue.github.io/portfolio/)

# **Summary**

Throughout my life I have been fearless about diving into new technologies
and continueing to learn more in the world of programming. I am an out of the box thinker looking for full-stack
developer projects that challenge me and enable me to utilizes my creative, organizational, and designing skills.
I enjoy analyzing problems and building systems to solve them. This site showcases some projects and my Resume please send me any comments, compliments or complaints I am always looking to improve and get feedback.

# **Explanation**

This site was built in two basic phases, phase one was the structure and functionality and phase two consisted of styling and debugging.

#### _Phase One_ of the site used:

> - **HTML5** to provide the basic structure and backbone of the application layout.
> - **Javascript** and **JQuery** to create interactivity.

#### _Phase Two_ of the site used:

> - **CS3** & **Bootstrap4** to style and for flexible layouts, flexible images and cascading style sheet media queries that create the desired views.

From the start of _Phase One_ **Vanilla Javascript** was utilized for animation and **DOM Scripting** for events and functionality. _Phase two_ consisted of refactoring styling to desired views and continuing to improve user interaction and design layout. After the basic structure was setup some distinctive and attractive features were added with **CS3** and **Bootstrap4**. A fun Easter Egg was included when you click to see Resume PDF. **JQuery** and **Javascript** event handling was used to animate light bulb picture in the About Section.

## _Color Palette_ Adopted

Here is a site that drew my eye because if incorporated my favorite colors I created a color palette using Google chrome extension `color palette creator`

## _Inspiration_ For Site

Here is the site I saw that inspired my portfolio page.

# **Problem**

During development issues occured regarding:
> - Image sizes
> - Rendering content in appropriate sections and divs
> - Displaying matching colors from color palette in specified elements and psuedo classes.

Many of the issues stemmed from using a particles.js file that required several scripts and additional javascript files. While visually impressive the complex code used to render the particles resulted in several layout issues and conflicted with many elements and classes.

You can see below that I encounted some display issues during development.

# **Solution**

Isolating each section and clearly writing out psuedo code helped target problem areas. I went into VS Code editor and went over code line by line. Being able to isolate code snippets and blocks was crucial. Using Dev tools inspect I was able to manipulate and target problematic elements and structure faults. Piece by piece I was able to render desired look. I continue to make improvements my commits are frequent and often. My motto being make it work, then make it work better (adopted from a talented code professor I had at Rutgers Full-Stack Program).

# **Results**

While I enjoy leveraging the use of **Bootstrap** and **JQuery** it is important to me to have a strong foundation in fundamentals like **CSS** and **HTML** for Front-End. I look forward to taking my project to the next level by building a Back-End and including much more interactivity and hidden functionality in the Site. 
Many of the frameworks, libraries and packages used today bypass the need to write such lengthy code and make frontend web development much easier. However it is important to understand what all these frameworks libraries and packages are accomplishing behind the scenes. This knowledge is essential to really understand programming and what is happening when a user enters and interacts with a site or application.

# **Conclusion**

Staying organized and writing clean psuedo code that is univerally understood (not just by me) is crucial in web development. I take pride in my organization that was adopted during the development of this page and will continue to apply these fundamentals in future projects.

There are many programmers out in the world that blindly use libraries, frameworks and packages without knowing what they are executing or doing behind the scenes. It is very similar to the way people use the english language and use acronyms without knowing their meaning or what they stand for. Of course you can properly use many words without knowing their origin or true meaning. For example, many people use the word _zip_ code every day not knowing that it stands for “Zoning Improvement Plan” a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) since 1963. _Laser_ stands for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”, _Scuba_ stands for “Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, _Taser_ stands for “Thomas A Swift Electric Rifle, _CARE_ Package stands for “Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere” Packages, and so on…

The point is, all these acronyms are used by people regularly in communication, without these people being aware of the meaning behind the words. A similar situation occurs in programming. Many shortcuts, abbreviations, packages, libraries and frameworks have been created and adopted by programmers. These programmers have not bothered to learn what these consolidated lines of code actually mean and thus sometimes fall victim to sloppy unorganized code that is difficult to follow with little psuedo code. Luckily, thanks to my education and determination to build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, I do not fall victim to this “TechnoTardic” Naiveté. I encourage you to look at my code and let me know if you are unable to follow any particular part. Socrates said something to the effect of "I know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance" maintaining this thought in your programming careers inspires you to continously learn and improve your skills.
